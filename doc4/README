Settings:
=========

Please use "settings.py.example" provided in this same directory to know
how to configure your "settings.py" for usage whith this application.

It is important to copy the section between:
# Doc4 settings
and:
# Django settings
in your own project's settings.


URLS:
====
do not forget to include doc4.urls in your django project's URLS.

If you include doc4 in an existing project, you need to add the
following in the main project's urls.py (see doc4/urls.py.project_example):

from django.conf import settings
import os
if hasattr(settings, 'DOC4_BASE_URL'):
    DOC4_BASE_URL = os.path.join(settings.DOC4_BASE_URL, '')
else:
    DOC4_BASE_URL = ''

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^%s' % DOC4_BASE_URL, include(doc4urlpatterns)),
)

This is because because of the following django bug:
http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9176
which the django comunity is not willing to fix for the moment.
(Ticket #9176's status is "closed: wontfix")

Logging:
========
If you activate logging the same way as in the "settings.py.example"
file, please create a "logs" directory in your django project's root
directory.

Please read the REQUIREMENTS file
