This is an old project started at Mandriva to do an equivalent of               
packages.debian.org, but for rpm distros.                                       
                                                                                
I uploaded it on GitHub to preserve the Code after the Mandriva company has  
been shutdown. The original code was on an svn server, but I can't convert it   
to git and keep the commit history because the server is down, git conversion
needs the svn server to be still running, so the commit history is lost.                                   
                                                                                
This code was developed a while ago and used django-piston for the API part.   
Django-piston is not maintained anymore and will not work with the current      
django version. so all the API related code needs to be ported to               
django-rest-framework.                                                          
                                                                                
The Database Schema was not created specificaly for this project, this project
was developed to use an existing database.

The web templates were without design, and need customization and CSS.

Feel free to fork this project and improve it.
